## üí° Recommendations

Based on the finding that seniors are a high-risk group, the primary recommendation is to **introduce a targeted 'Senior Saver' plan**.

This data-driven strategy could include simplified features and a lower price point to better meet the needs of this demographic. This initiative has the potential to **reduce churn in this key segment and retain over 80 customers annually**.
